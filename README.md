# 🧠 MedSight AI

**MedSight AI** is a deep learning-based medical diagnostic tool that analyzes CT scan images of the **lungs**, **breast**, and **brain** to detect cancer and predict its severity. It generates **Grad-CAM heatmaps** for infected areas and offers personalized **Do’s and Don’ts** based on the predicted **malignancy score** (ranging from 1 to 5).

> ⚠️ This tool requires a CUDA-enabled **GPU** with **at least 8GB VRAM**. It does **not** support CPU-only systems.

## 🧠 Malignancy Score Scale

| Score | Description                  |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 1     | No signs of cancer           |
| 2     | Low suspicion                |
| 3     | Indeterminate                |
| 4     | Moderately likely cancer     |
| 5     | Highly likely / serious case |

## 💡 Sample Prediction Output

**Class: 1 (No signs of cancer)**  
- ✅ Lungs appear healthy and clear  
- ❌ No abnormal growths or spots  
- 🛑 No treatment or follow-up required  
- 🗓️ Keep up with routine annual check-ups  

> ✔️ **Analysis Complete** — Please consult a medical professional for further evaluation.
